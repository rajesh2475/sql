Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.

The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:

MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column
Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT()).

select * from orders limit 10;

select * from orders limit 1,1;  // SQL
select * from orders limit 1, offset 1; // Postgres
select count(*) from orders;

order by desc or asc (default)

select destinct order_statue from orders;
select * from orders where order_statue = "COMPLETE" or order_statue = "CLOSED";

select to_char(order_date, 'YYYY-MM') as order_month, count (*) as order_count from orders where order_status in ('COMPLETE', 'CLOSED') group by 1 order by 2;   - here 1 refers ro first column of results in select

select order_item_order_id, round(sum(order_item_subtotal)::numeric, 2) as order_revenue from order_items group by 1 order by 1;


Create table daily_product_revinue as

round(sum(order_item_subtotal)::numeric, 2) as order_revinue from orders as o
inner join order_items as oi on o.order_id = oi.order_item_product_id

# views
1. views do not hold any data
2. We create views using queries against the tables
3. we typically create views for commonly used queries

EX 
Create view <view name> as 
Quary

To recreate the view we use
Create or replace view <view name> as 
Quary



CTE (common table expression)
Ex 
with <name_of_the_query> as 
Query

CTE is similar to views but they don't store definition within the database, Once We restart the session CTE will be deleted.
